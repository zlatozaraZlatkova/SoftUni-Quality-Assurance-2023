# Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing

## Course Info

The course examines fundamental programming concepts that serve as the foundation for efficient and superior learning in professional automated testing modules. The students build upon the knowledge acquired in the QA Fundamentals (Manual) module and commence acquiring fundamental programming skills, including the ability to write entry-level code (basic coding skills), utilize an IDE, utilize variables and data, operators and expressions, work with the console (reading input data and printing results), utilize conditional statements (if, if-else), loops (for, while, do-while), and conduct component testing. The course will also encompass fundamental programming structures such as arrays, lists, and objects. It ends with a practical project where students create and test a console game. The course successfully builds students' awareness of the upcoming professional modules and the knowledge they will gain from them to become successful "Automated Software Testing" professionals.
